      <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 4, 2025</p>
      <p>
        Welcome to the <strong>QR Code for T-Shirts</strong> mini project! By
        using this service, you agree to the following terms. This project is
        designed for fun and dabbling — please use it responsibly.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Registration</h2>
      <p>
        Users must register with a valid email to generate a unique QR code. You
        are responsible for keeping your login details safe.
      </p>

      <h2>2. QR Code Usage</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Your QR code is personal and linked to your uploads.</li>
        <li>
          Do not share or use QR codes for illegal, offensive, or harmful
          purposes.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Media Uploads</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You may upload <strong>one image at a time</strong> per account.
        </li>
        <li>
          Uploads must not contain nudity, hate speech, or copyrighted content
          without permission.
        </li>
        <li>You are solely responsible for any image you upload.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Preview and Display</h2>
      <p>
        Before finalizing, you can preview how your upload will look. Once
        confirmed, the QR code will lead to your fullscreen display page.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Visit Tracker</h2>
      <p>
        A counter shows how many people scanned/visited your page. This is for
        curiosity only — no personal tracking is done.
      </p>

      <h2>6. About Page</h2>
      <p>
        The project includes an About page to guide you through registration,
        upload, and QR usage. Please review it before starting.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Limitations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This is a playful, non-commercial project — there are no uptime
          guarantees.
        </li>
        <li>
          The service may be updated, changed, or discontinued without prior
          notice.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Liability Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        We provide this project “as is.” We are not responsible for how QR
        codes, images, or links are used outside this platform.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>
        These terms are governed by the laws of your jurisdiction. By using this
        service, you accept these conditions.
      </p>
