# 🎉 Mini Fun Project – QR Code for T-Shirts

This is a fun mini project designed for dabblers → people who casually invest effort into quirky or even “pointless” pursuits.  
The idea is to generate custom QR codes that look stylish on T-shirt prints and link to a personalized media page.

# ✨ Features

- New QR code for every registered user

  - User registers via email.
  - Each registration generates a custom QR code with a playful “Scan Me” message, hidden creatively for T-shirt design.

- Media Uploads (restricted to 1 at a time)

  - After login, the user can upload an image.
  - Provides a preview link before finalizing, so the user can see how it looks on their page.
  - User can later replace the image with another upload.

- Auto-Rotating Display (optional upgrade)

  - If multiple uploads are allowed in the future, the page can rotate images at a selected time interval.

- Personalized Media Page

  - Each QR leads to a fullscreen page showing the uploaded image.
  - A tracker at the bottom counts how many people visited/scanned the QR.

- About Page

  - Explains how to use the project and the steps (register → upload → preview → share QR).

- Deployment
  - The whole project is Dockerized for easy hosting and portability.

# 🌀 Flow

1. Register with email → get your unique QR code.
2. Login → upload one image (with preview before finalizing).
3. QR Code → scan to view the image page.
4. Tracker → see how many people scanned your QR.
5. About Page → learn how the system works.

# 🧩 Why?

Because sometimes dabbling is fun — this project is not about productivity, but about creativity, playfulness, and giving people a small tech-powered joy.
