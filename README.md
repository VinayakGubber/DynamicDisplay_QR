# DynamicDisplay_QR
A fun web app where users sign up, upload images, GIFs, or videos, and get a unique QR code to their fullscreen display page. Scanning the QR shows their latest upload without any site elements. An upload dashboard lets users preview content and track daily visits, resetting at midnight.
